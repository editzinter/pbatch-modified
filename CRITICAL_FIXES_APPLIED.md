# ðŸš¨ CRITICAL FIXES APPLIED - Bot Now Much More Aggressive

## Problem Identified
The bot was only playing 2 cards per match because the action scoring was **WAY TOO RESTRICTIVE**. 

## ðŸ”§ Major Fixes Applied

### 1. **Spell Actions (Fireball, Zap)** 
- **Before**: Required `MIN_SCORE = 5` (hit 5+ enemy units)
- **After**: Reduced to `MIN_SCORE = 2` (hit only 2+ enemy units)
- **Impact**: Spells will fire much more frequently

### 2. **Giant Action**
- **Before**: Only played when elixir was EXACTLY 10
- **After**: Plays when elixir is 6+ 
- **Impact**: Giant pushes start much earlier and more frequently

### 3. **Bridge Actions (Mini P.E.K.K.A)**
- **Before**: Only played when elixir was EXACTLY 10
- **After**: Plays when elixir is 7+
- **Impact**: Counter-attacks and offense happen much more often

### 4. **Archers Action**
- **Before**: Only gave 0.5 score when elixir was exactly 10
- **After**: Gives 0.7 score when elixir is 3+
- **Impact**: Cheap cycle card now plays frequently

### 5. **Ranged Actions (Musketeer, Baby Dragon)**
- **Before**: Only played against enemies exactly 5-6 tiles away
- **After**: Play against enemies 3-8 tiles away, plus proactively when elixir is high
- **Impact**: Much more flexible positioning and proactive plays

### 6. **Defense Actions (Knight)**
- **Before**: Only played when enemies were actively attacking
- **After**: Also plays proactively when elixir is 8+ for positioning
- **Impact**: Better defensive positioning and elixir management

## ðŸŽ¯ Expected Results

**Before Fixes:**
- Only 2 cards played per match
- Constant "no good action" messages
- Bot waited for perfect conditions that rarely occurred

**After Fixes:**
- 15-25 cards played per match
- Much fewer "no good action" messages  
- Proactive and aggressive gameplay
- Better elixir cycling and management

## ðŸš€ Ready to Test
Run the bot now with:
```bash
python main.py --optimal
# or
python main_continuous.py
```

The bot should now be MUCH more active and aggressive!
